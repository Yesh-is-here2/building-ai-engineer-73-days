Day 60 - End-to-End ML Pipeline (offline-safe)

Goal:
- Demonstrate a complete mini ML pipeline with real artifacts:
  ingest -> train -> evaluate -> batch predict -> package outputs

Artifacts produced:
- artifacts/files/data.csv
- artifacts/files/model.json
- artifacts/files/metrics.json
- artifacts/files/predictions.csv
- artifacts/files/pipeline_summary.txt
- artifacts/files/main_output.txt

Why this matters:
- This mirrors production structure even without real cloud:
  reproducible data, model artifact, evaluation metrics, and outputs.
