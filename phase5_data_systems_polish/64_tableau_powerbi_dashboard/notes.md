Day 64 - Tableau / Power BI Dashboard (artifact-based)

Goal:
- Use Tableau Public (or Power BI) to build a dashboard from a clean dataset.
- Commit proof artifacts (CSV + screenshot/PDF).

This module generates:
- artifacts/files/sales_dashboard_data.csv
- artifacts/files/dataset_meta.json
- artifacts/files/main_output.txt

Manual (Tableau Public):
1) Connect -> Text file -> sales_dashboard_data.csv
2) Build dashboard:
   - KPI: Total Revenue
   - Revenue Trend by Date
   - Revenue by Region
   - Revenue by Channel
   - Top Products by Revenue
3) Export an image/PDF as proof into artifacts/files/
